Tesla is investigating bottlenecks in their production, and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a SQL query that determines which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumption:
Table parts_assembly contains all parts in production.   

parts_assembly Table:
Column Name	Type
part	        string
finish_date	datetime
assembly_step	integer


parts_assembly Example Input:
part	finish_date	assembly_step 
battery	1/22/2022 0:00	1
battery	2/22/2022 0:00	2
battery	3/22/2022 0:00	3
bumper	1/22/2022 0:00	1
bumper	2/22/2022 0:00	2
bumper		        3
bumper		        4

Example Output:
part
bumper

Explanation:
The only item in the output is "bumper" because step 3 didn't have a finish date.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!


Solution:
select part 
from parts_assembly
where finish_date is null
group by part;
