Given a table of bank deposits and withdrawals, return the final balance for each account.

Assumption:
All the transactions performed for each account are present in the table; no transactions are missing.

Transactions Table:
Column Name	  Type
transaction_id	  integer
account_id	  integer
transaction_type  varchar
amount	          decimal

Transactions Example Input:
transaction_id	account_id	transaction_type	amount
123	101	Deposit	10.00
124	101	Deposit	20.00
125	101	Withdrawal	5.00
126	201	Deposit	20.00
128	201	Withdrawal	10.00

Example Output:
account_id	final_balance
101	        25.00
201	        10.00

Explanation:
In total, $30.00 were deposited to account 101, and $5.00 were withdrawn. Therefore, the final balance will be $30.00-$5.00 = $25.00

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!


Solution:
select account_id,
sum(case when transaction_type = 'Deposit' then amount end) -
sum(case when transaction_type = 'Withdrawal' then amount end)
from transactions
group by account_id;
