Assume you are given the table below containing tweet data. Write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket, and then the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

tweets Table:
Column Name	Type
tweet_id	integer
user_id	        integer
msg	        string
tweet_date	timestamp

tweets Example Input:
tweet_iduser_id	    msg	tweet_date
214252	     111	        Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.	12/30/2021 00:00:00
739252	     111	        Despite the constant negative press covfefe	01/01/2022 00:00:00
846402	     111	        Following @NickSinghTech on Twitter changed my life!	02/14/2022 00:00:00
241425	     254	        If the salary is so competitive why wonâ€™t you tell me what it is?	03/01/2022 00:00:00
231574	     148	        I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed	03/23/2022 00:00:00

Example Output:
tweet_bucket	users_num
1	        2
2	        1

Explanation: 2 users fall under the 1 tweet bucket whereas 1 user is in the 2 tweets bucket.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!


Solution:
with cte as (select user_id,count(msg) tweet_bucket
from tweets
where tweet_date between '01/01/2022' and '12/31/2022'
group by user_id)
select tweet_bucket,count(user_id) users_num
from cte
group by tweet_bucket;
