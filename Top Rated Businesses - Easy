Assume you are given the table below containing information on user reviews. Write a query to obtain the number and percentage of businesses that are top rated. A top-rated busines is defined as one whose reviews contain only 4 or 5 stars.
Output the number of businesses and percentage of top rated businesses rounded to the nearest integer.

Assumption:
Each business has only one review (which is the business' average rating).

reviews Table:
Column Name	Type
business_id	integer
review_id	integer
review_stars	integer
review_date	datetime

reviews Example Input:
business_id	review_id	review_stars	review_date
532	1234	5	07/13/2022 12:00:00
824	1452	3	07/13/2022 12:00:00
819	2341	5	07/13/2022 12:00:00
716	1325	4	07/14/2022 12:00:00
423	1434	2	07/14/2022 12:00:00

Example Output:
business_count	top_rated_pct
3	60

Explanation: 
There are 3 business with the rating at least 4 - business ids 532;819;716. The total count of the businesses is 5, resulting in a percentage of 3/5 = 60%.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!


Solution:
select count(business_id) as business_count,round(count(business_id)*1.0/(select count(business_id) from reviews)*100,0) as top_rated_pct
from reviews 
where review_stars in ('4','5');
